I think I was able to make the functionality part farily well. All the required are there and working correctly.
The only thing I didn't do so well was the UI part. I'm never good at the front end stuff and how to make thing look good. It will take me much more time to accomplish that and it just kind of overwhelming to me. Therefore, it is how it looks like now.
For the reasons mentioned above, I'm hoping for to get a grade of 23 or even 24. Thank you.
